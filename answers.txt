Design decision:

I decided to implement recovery using the data structures for Aries,
including hashtables to hold the active transaction table and the dirty
page table. I used a hash table from transactionIds to a list off LSNs
at which updates are made to enable the undo chaining.


Difficult parts:

In rollback, I was stuck until I realized that I also needed to represent the
disk writing in the BufferPool data structure that maps pid's to pages.

In undo, I had a hard time figuring out how to undo the changes made by the
transactions that are active at the last checkpoint, since all changes are
flushed to disk, and there is no longer access to those transactions that
occur before the checkpoint. I re-add these to my recovery data structures
at the start of my undo phase.

Changes outside of LogFile:

As described above, I needed to update the changes that I made in rolling back
the data in my pageMap structure from BufferPool, which tracks the pages
in the BufferPool, since it is used in transactionComplete.

Note:
testFiveThreads and testTenThreads will sometimes fail, caused by a concurrency
issue from lab 3.
